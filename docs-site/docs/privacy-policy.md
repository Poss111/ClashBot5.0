# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 5th, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how the Clash Companion app (“the app”) collects, uses, and shares information. It also explains your rights and choices.

## Information we collect
- **Account and profile data:** Information you provide when signing up or updating your profile (e.g., name, email, team details).
- **Usage data:** App interactions, feature usage, diagnostics, and crash information.
- **Device and network data:** Device model, OS version, app version, timezone, and coarse network information necessary for service reliability.
- **Optional data (only if the app requests it):** Location, camera, microphone, photos/files, or notifications. These are requested with runtime permission and only when a feature needs them.
- **Third-party SDK data:** Some SDKs (analytics, crash reporting, performance monitoring, push, or ads if used) may receive data needed to provide their services. See “Third parties” below.

## How we use information
- Provide and improve app functionality and reliability.
- Authenticate users and secure access.
- Communicate service updates and respond to support requests.
- Analyze aggregated usage to improve performance and features.
- Deliver notifications or in-app messages you opt into.

## Legal bases (where applicable)
- Perform our contract with you (provide the app and its features).
- Legitimate interests (service reliability, security, and quality), balanced with your rights.
- Consent (for optional permissions, notifications, or analytics/ads where required).

## Sharing
We do not sell personal data. We may share:

- **Service providers / processors:** Hosting, analytics, crash reporting, and customer support tools, limited to what they need to operate.
- **Legal and safety:** If required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity of the service.

## Data retention
- We retain personal data only as long as needed for the purposes above, or as required by law. When data is no longer needed, we delete or de-identify it.

## Security
- We use technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk (encryption in transit, access controls, and monitoring). No system is 100% secure.

## Your rights and choices
Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict your data, or to object to certain processing. You can also withdraw consent for optional features. See **Account Deletion** for how to request deletion.

## Children
The app is not directed to children under the minimum age in your region, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children without appropriate parental consent. If you believe we have collected such data, contact us to request deletion.

## International transfers

If data is transferred across borders, we use appropriate safeguards where required (such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent).
