# Data Privacy Overview

This page summarizes how the app handles data and how it maps to the Google Play Data Safety form.

## Data categories and purposes

- **Account and profile data:** Used to create and maintain your account and team participation.
- **Usage and diagnostics:** Used to keep the app reliable, detect issues, and improve performance.
- **Device and network metadata:** Used for security, fraud prevention, and service quality.
- **Optional permissions:** Requested only when needed for a feature; you can decline optional permissions.

## Optional permissions (examples to customize)

- **Location:** If used, we request foreground location only when needed for a feature; background location is requested separately with clear justification.
- **Camera / Photos:** If used for profile images or uploads, we ask at point-of-use and only read selected items.
- **Notifications:** Asked when we need to send you updates; you can turn them off in system settings or in-app.

## Data retention

- Personal data is retained only as long as needed for the purposes above. When no longer necessary, it is deleted or de-identified.
- You can request deletion of your account data; see **Account Deletion**.

## Data sharing

- We do not sell personal data.
- Service providers (hosting, analytics, crash reporting, messaging) may process data strictly to operate the app.

## Security

- Data in transit is encrypted with HTTPS. Access to production data is restricted and monitored.

## Your choices

- Decline optional permissions with minimal feature impact beyond what is necessary for that feature.
  - e.g. Do not login with Google and not sharing your email with the app but still being able to view upcoming Tournaments and news.
- Manage notifications in system settings or in-app (if provided).
- Request access, correction, or deletion of your data via the instructions in **Account Deletion**.
